Task 1
1a) 
- Component-based Architecture
React apps are built using reusable pieces called components. Each component handles its own logic and UI, and can be mix and matched without starting 
from scratch every time.

- Virtual DOM
Instead of re-rendering the entire webpage every time something changes, React keeps a copy of the page called the Virtual DOM. When there are any state changes, 
React compares this copy to the real page and only re-renders what's needed. 


- Unidirectional Data Flow
Data in React moves in one direction, from parent components down to their children. This keeps thing predictable and debuggable.

1b)
These features make React ideal for modern web apps, because of the following reasons:
- Easy to scale. When a new feature is needed, just plug in a new component.
- Quicker rendering. Due to the Virtual DOM being used, the app looks a lot more snappy with dynamic content.
- One-way data flow means fewer bugs and easier debugging.
